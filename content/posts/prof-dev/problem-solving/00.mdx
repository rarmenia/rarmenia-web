Working in a professional setting can be stressful. Sometimes you are met with problems that are so complex that you don’t know where to start, and that can make you feel inadequate and discouraged. While these thoughts are perfectly normal, you can learn how to work past them and create systems to solve anything, even the most complex issues.

Why do we waste so much time feeling inadequate? While I am not an expert in psychology, I believe that people are incredibly skilled at pattern recognition. Whether conscious of it or not, we detect patterns all around us in every one. While this is a useful skill to our survival, it can also be harmful because sometimes we get it wrong. We misinterpret a pattern or think we see one that doesn’t really exist! We are also generally pretty bad at objective self-analysis, especially when it comes to comparing ourselves with others. Since we only experience our own perspective, we often end up with distorted ideas about the professional performance of others. We only see the “final product” or an individual’s best work. What we haven’t seen is all of the hard work leading up to it. It’s easy to see the line of thinking here. Using our pattern recognition skills, we come to a conclusion that: “Other people always easily succeed, and therefore my struggle is indicative of a lack of skill.”

While it’s normal to get stuck in this line of thinking, it’s also incredibly flawed. How many times did these success stories fail before they succeeded? Did they have help? Did they work on something similar previously? Do they have systems in place to minimize problems? It’s impossible to know the answers to all of these questions from the outside, but they are crucial questions to ask and learn from.

How do we move past this mental block? Everyone is different, but learning problem solving methods and reassuring yourself throughout your endeavors are good steps. Every problem, no matter how complex, can be broken into a series of smaller, simpler problems. Conversely — every solution, no matter how complex, can be broken into a series of smaller, simpler solutions. Breaking down these problems and solutions is a skill that anyone can hone and master through practice.

I look forward to going through this process with you in future posts and strengthening our skills together!
