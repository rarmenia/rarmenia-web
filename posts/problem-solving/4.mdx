Working in a professional setting can be stressful. Sometimes you are met with problems that are so complex that you don't know where to start, and that can lead to feelings of inadequacy and discouragement. These feelings are perfectly normal, and while learning to manage the feelings themselves is helpful you can also learn how to prevent them in the first place.

When we look at someone's work, we often just see the finished product, not the struggle that went into it. When you see others succeeding while you are having a hard time its easy to come to the conclusion that they are just better than you, or that you are just lacking, but that most likely isn't true or at least that is not the entire story.

While it is normal to fall into this line of thinking, so normal that is has been given the name imposter syndrome, the truth is that it is flawed. People are really good at finding patterns, even those that don't exist, and incredibly bad at objective self analysis. Often the only real difference in professionals is the experience one has at solving problems.

In truth, every single complex problem can be broken up into simpler problems, maybe even ones that have a standard or agreed upon solution. Often these complex problems are all about linking together these simple solutions.

The goal of this series is to go through this problem solving process within the context of web development, while this may seem pretty specific the process and tools are transferable to other professions and can be even further applied to daily life.
